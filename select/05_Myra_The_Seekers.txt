Chorus:
Myra, Myra, many boats in the harbour;
Gonna go down south and make many fast dollar,
And shake up the party, shake up the party;
Oh, Myra, Myra, many boats in the harbour;
Gonna go down south and make many fast dollar,
And shake up the party, shake up the party.
Myra, go down to the harbour;
I tell you, Myra, go down to the harbour;
Won't you hear me, Myra, go down to the harbour,
'Cause the big white ship pulled in today.
(Chorus)
I no time to see Myra today;
I tell you, no time to see Myra today;
I no time to see Myra today;
'Cause the big white ship, she sail away.
(Chorus)
