I wish you where here
But I can feel you near
I look to the skies at night and I still see your light
Yeah!

A new life
A long love
Your limits are the skies above
All you are now is deprived
And we pray for you to survive

Those we love won't fade away
They will walk beside us even when we stray
And I will find a way to heal my heart
You will live on through me
A brand new start

Strength is born in the silence of suffering
Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death
Go!

Your fears will starve to death
Your fears will starve to death

A relentless disease that tears through your bones
Such a new life you now owe
My life forever riddled with fraught
From all the anguish you have brought

Those we love won't fade away
They will walk beside us even when we stray
And I will find a way to heal my heart
You will live on through me
A brand new start

He will be your peace
I'm praying for you
Your pain has ceased
But I'm still here
He will be your peace
Still I wait for you
My pain will never cease
One day I will join you

Those we love won't fade away
They will walk beside us even when we stray
And I will find a way to heal my heart
You will live on through me
A brand new start

Those we love
Will never fade away

I wish you where here
But I can feel you near
I look to the skies at night and still see your light
Strength is born in the silence of suffering
Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death

Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death
